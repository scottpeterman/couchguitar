Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
			 D
That saved a wretch like me.
     G                C       G
I once was lost, but now im found,
    Em         D     G
Was blind, but now I see.

     G                     C        G
Twas grace that thought my heart to fear,
                     D           G   
and grace my fears released. How precious
         C      G      Em            D   G   
did that grace appear, the  hour I first believed.

 G                           C       G
When we've been there ten thousand years,
 G                     D 
bright shining as the sun,
  G                     C           G
we've no less days to sing god's praise
  G                D          G
than when did when we first begun.
